# wisd-hackathon - trickshots team submission 

To run this project, be sure to clone this repo and open the project folder in R Studio. dashboard.R contains the code for the shiny application, while events_np.csv contians the data that was used for shot prediction analysis. When opening the project in R Studio, make sure to set the working directory to the proper folder name using the top nav bar: Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory. 

Before running this application, make sure that all necessary packages/libraries are downloaded. To check what libraries are currently added, type the command
`installed.packages()` in the R Studio Console. If some packages are missing, use `install.packages("package-name-here")` to install the remaining ones necessary. 

Then, you should see the 'Run App' button on the right. Click this button and the visual can be opened in an external window. [Here](https://meganmehta.shinyapps.io/wisd-trickshots/) is the link to my deployed version!
